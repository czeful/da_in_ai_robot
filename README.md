# da_in_ai_robot

This project focuses on data analysis and building machine learning models for classifying the actions of a mobile robot based on sensor data.

## Project Goal
To examine the structure of a robot's sensor data, identify hidden relationships between features and actions, and build an interpretable classification model.

## Methods Used
- Data Preprocessing and Analysis (EDA)
- Association Analysis (Apriori, FP-Growth)
- Classification Using Random Forest
- Feature Importance Analysis
- Model Interpretation Using SHAP
- Model Quality Assessment (Confusion Matrix)

## Main Results
- Robust association rules between sensor readings were identified
- A Random Forest model with high classification accuracy was built
- The most significant features influencing the robot's decision-making were identified
- An interpretation of the contribution of features for each action class was obtained
